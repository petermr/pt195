The shifts are given on page 5278 in the text: "Complex 2 exhibits a 195Pt NMR chemical shift at −2702 ppm, downfield of the starting material (AsPh4)[Pt(C2H4)Cl3] at −2751 ppm. To gain a wider frame of reference, we also recorded the 195Pt NMR spectrum for a carbide-bridged analog of 2, (AsPh4)[(Cy3P)2Cl2RuC−PtCl3], which exhibits a strongly downfield shifted 195Pt NMR resonance at −2499 ppm." The struture is in Scheme 1 (not numbered) and in Fig. 3 (difficult to read). I think this is not a realistic example.
