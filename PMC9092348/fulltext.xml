cytotoxicity is strictly related to their ability
to be converted into active mono- and di-aquated species and consequently
to the replacement of labile ligands by water molecules. This activation
process makes the platinum center prone to nucleophilic substitution
by DNA purines. In the present work, quantum mechanical density functional
theory (DFT) computations and experimental investigations were carried
out in order to shed light on the relationship between the internalization,
aquation, and DNA binding of two isostructural anionic theranostic
complexes previously reported by our group, NBu<sub>4</sub>[(PhPy)Pt(Aliz)], <bold>1 (</bold>IC<sub>50</sub> 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.6 &#x003bc;M), and NBu<sub>4</sub>[(PhPy)Pt(BrCat)], <bold>2 (</bold>IC<sub>50</sub> 52.8 &#x000b1; 3.9
&#x003bc;M). Cisplatin and a neutral compound [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pt(Aliz)], <bold>3</bold>, were also taken as reference compounds.
The computed energy barriers and the endergonicity of the hydrolysis
reactions showed that the aquation rates are comparable for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, with a slightly higher reactivity of <bold>1</bold>. The second hydrolysis process was proved to be the rate-determining
step for both <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, unlike for compound <bold>3</bold>. The nucleophilic attack by the N7 site of guanine to both
mono- and di-aquated forms of the complexes was computationally investigated
as well, allowing to rationalize the observed different cytotoxicity.
Computational results were supported by photostability data and biological
assays, demonstrating DNA as the main target for compound <bold>1</bold>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>An experimental&#x02212;theoretical approach

in medical protocols, cisplatin and its derivatives
continue to play a central role as first-line therapy drugs for the
treatment of different types of tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> More than 40 years after the recognition of the cisplatin clinical
benefits, studies still continue to be carried out in an effort to
comprehensively understand its mechanism of action. Four main steps,
internalization, aquation, formation of DNA adducts, and cell response,
have been identified to explain the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin
and its derivatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Because the first step consists
in drug internalization, its accumulation inside the cells surely
represents the limiting step of its bioactivity. The cellular uptake
of platinum drugs through the cellular membranes has been assumed
to occur by both passive diffusion and through specific channels.
In the last decades, compelling evidence for a more prominent role
of carrier-mediated platinum drug uptake has rapidly accumulated in
the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Inside the cells, the
second step of the mechanism of action is aquation, which allows the
activation of platinum drugs, thanks to the replacement of relatively
labile ligands prone to nucleophilic substitution, such as chloride
in cisplatin. The successive step of the mechanism of action involves
the interaction between the active aquated complex with DNA. The cytotoxic
activity of cisplatin is ascribed to its interaction with nucleophilic
sites of purine bases in DNA, mainly the N7-site of guanine, to form
inter- and intrastrand crosslinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> inducing
structural distortion. Following DNA damage, cells might repair themselves
and then continue through the cell cycle, but if they are not able
to repair the damage, cells will proceed to apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> As widely demonstrated, the main species responsible for the DNA
binding, in cisplatin, is the mono-aquated complex, <italic>cis</italic>[Pt-Cl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup>,
while the reaction of the di-aquated species, which seems to be kinetically
controlled, gives only a minor contribution to the binding between
DNA and the platinum drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> It is worth mentioning,
however, that some studies describe the di-aquated form of the drug
as the major DNA-binding species because of the double charge and
the better H-bond-donating capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> With
the aim of improving the cisplatin properties by the kinetic control
of the aquation step, different complexes with ligands less prone
to be displaced by water were synthesized such as carboplatin and
oxaliplatin. Both of them differ from cisplatin in that they contain
dicarboxylate chelate-leaving ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Such bidentate ligands, when hydrolysis takes place, are displaced
in a stepwise fashion by the water nucleophile. In the case of carboplatin,
the first hydrolysis causing the opening of the malonate ring is a
very slow process compared to chloride substitution in cisplatin and
also oxaliplatin, very likely due to the steric hindrance of the ligand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> As a result, a monodentate malonate ligand is
obtained, and the kinetic behavior depends on the acid conditions
influencing the degree of protonation of the Pt(II) complex. The rate
of labile ligand substitution reaction in Pt(II) complexes depends
not only on the identity of the leaving ligands but also on the nature
of the diamine ligands <italic>trans</italic> to them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> On the basis of this assumption, in this work,
we evaluated the relationship that should exist between the capability
of internalization, aquation, and DNA binding, and the cytotoxic profile
of two anionic Pt(II) complexes, previously synthetized by our research
group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> bearing two different chelate-leaving
ligands, alizarine or tetrabromocatechol. Both these ligands allow
the formation of ionic Pt(II) complexes and possess the same chelating
O^O fragment, derived from 1,2-dihydroxybenzene. While alizarine possesses
an extended aromatic system, the electronegative bromine atoms placed
onto the catecholate ligand insures localization of the withdrawing
electronic effect onto the chelated 1,2-dihydroxybenzene ring. Noteworthily,
the cytotoxic activity of the two complexes is highly different. The
alizarine derivative showed high response against human triple-negative
breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, while the catecholate parent is
rather inactive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> To explain such disparity
in behavior, a joint computational and experimental investigation
was carried out. Quantum mechanical density functional theory (DFT)
computations, supported by the detection of photophysical properties
of the selected complexes, were employed to examine aquation steps,
guanine binding, and deactivation interactions with model sulfur-containing
molecules.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Computational Details</title><p>All the calculations were performed

reaction of square-planar d<sup>8</sup> complexes is realized according
to an associative mechanism in which the displacement of the leaving
group by a water molecule passes through the formation of a pseudo-trigonal
bipyramid transition state,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> following
the scheme included in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>, drawn for the two anionic complexes <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>. As explained in our previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> to take into
consideration the explicit solvent environment, in the starting adduct
(ADD), the Pt(II) complexes were surrounded by six solvent molecules,
which establish a network of hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms
of the (O^O) leaving group.</p><p>The first hydrolysis product, INT,
is obtained with the detachment
of an oxygen atom of both (BrCat)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> or (Aliz)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> ligands through the five-coordinated transition state
TS1. The final di-aquo complex, PROD, is formed by the definitive
release of the (O^O) ligand and the concerted water molecule entrance
in the first coordination shell of the Pt(II) center overcoming the
energy barrier corresponding to a penta-coordinated transition state
(TS2). Because of the asymmetric structure of the (C^N) PhPy ligand,
the water attack and the detachment of the oxygen atom of the leaving
ligand can occur in the <italic>trans</italic> or in <italic>cis</italic> position with respect to the C-coordinated atom of PhPy. Preliminary
calculations performed on <bold>1</bold> evidenced that because of
the trans effect, such attack takes place preferentially in the <italic>trans</italic> position to the carbon atom of the PhPy ligand. Thus,
only the mechanism for the displacement of the O1 atom by water is
reported for the investigated anionic complexes.</p><p>In the case
of complex <bold>1</bold>, given the asymmetry even
of the (Aliz)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> leaving ligand, two geometric isomers
were taken into consideration, in which the quinone part of (Aliz)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> lies on the same side, <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold>, or on the opposite side, <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>, of the
N-coordinated atom of the (C^N) ligand (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00842/suppl_file/ic2c00842_si_001.pdf">Figure S2</ext-link> of the Supporting Information). The calculated comparable
stabilities of the two isomers (&#x00394;<italic>E</italic> = 0.6 kcal
mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) fit with the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR evidence of
an approximately 1:1 cis/trans ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> The first hydrolysis of <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> occurs overcoming
a low-energy barrier of 12.1 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, while 18.9
kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> is required for the aquation of <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>B,C, respectively). The reaction is endergonic by 10.2
and 15.2 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> and <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>, respectively. The second hydrolysis
requires 21.4 and 25.0 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to occur in <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> and <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>, respectively.
In both cases, the whole hydrolysis reaction is endergonic by 15.7
kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for the <italic>cis</italic> isomer and
20.9 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for the <italic>trans</italic> one.
From these data, it emerges that both isomers can undergo the (O^O)
ligand substitution by two water molecules, even if both hydrolysis
steps are easier to occur on the <italic>cis</italic> than the <italic>trans</italic> isomer, from both kinetic and thermodynamic points
of view. Indeed, as the positions of the two oxygen atoms are interchanged
in the two isomers, the different charge distribution, due to the
asymmetric nature of the alizarine ligand, is interchanged as well.
The oxygen atom on the side of the quinone moiety, that is, the O1
atom in the <italic>cis</italic> isomer, is less nucleophilic, as
shown by the NBO analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> and, then, more prone
to be displaced by water. Analogous to the cisplatin-leading compound,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> the second hydrolysis of <bold>1</bold>, in both isomers, represents
the rate-determining step of the whole process. Compared to cisplatin
for which the first and second hydrolysis reactions are reported to
be endergonic (by 3.6 and 4.2 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively)
and the estimated energy barriers range from 19 to 23.3 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> computations
confirm the aquation viability for complex <bold>1</bold>.</p><p>Despite
the different identity of the (O^O) ligand, a similar behavior
was found for complex <bold>2</bold> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>D). Indeed, the second water substitution
remains the slowest step of the whole reaction and occurs overcoming
an energy barrier of 24.3 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and both the
first and second hydrolysis steps are endergonic of 11.4 and 21.4
kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively, likewise the energy expense
required for the aquation reaction of <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>.</p><p>A remarkable difference, instead, was found for the neutral
complex <bold>3</bold>. In this case, both being ancillary ligand
ammonia molecules,
no trans effect could be hypothesized, and both water attacks on the
oxygen atoms named O1 and O2 were taken into consideration. Then,
both first detachments of O1 or O2 allowing the entrance of a water
molecule were considered equally viable. As it is evident in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>E, the O1 detachment
(solid gray line) is the most favored one from both kinetic and thermodynamic
points of view, and the water attack from the side of O2 seems to
be hampered because no stationary points describing the second hydrolysis
step were located, despite the numerous attempts. The substantial
difference with respect to the anionic complexes relies on the involved
energy barrier for the first hydrolysis (26.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), that is higher than those computed for both <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, and represents the rate-limiting step of the whole process
in the case of <bold>3</bold>. The (Aliz)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> ligand
displacement by water definitively takes place by overcoming an energy
barrier of 25.0 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and the reaction product
(PROD) lies 16.2 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> above the zero reference
energy of the initial adduct (ADD).</p><p>Therefore, looking at the
energy barriers computed for the complexes
under examination as well as the endergonicity of the whole hydrolysis
reaction, it clearly appears that the aquation rates are comparable
to each other with only a slightly higher reactivity of <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold>.</p><p>Aquation reaction is propaedeutic to the
subsequent DNA platination
step in the mechanism of action of anticancer Pt(II) complexes achieved
through the attack of the aquated complex to DNA nucleobases. Computational
studies highlighted that the N7 site of the guanine nucleobase represents
the preferred site of attack by platinum-based drugs, leading to DNA
distortion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> Thus, the guanine attack
to both mono-aquo and di-aquo complexes was investigated. It is worthy
of note that the di-aquo complex obtained from both (BrCat)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> or (Aliz)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> displacement is the same, [(PhPy)Pt(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, while that coming from complex <bold>3</bold> di-aquation is the same as that obtained from cisplatin
hydrolysis, [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pt(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. Nevertheless, for the sake of comparison, also the
latter case was taken into consideration.</p><p>Guanine attack to
displace water from the mono-aquated form of
complex <bold>3</bold> was examined only for the intermediate that
was calculated to be more kinetically accessible. The results of this
exploration are reported in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> for both <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> complexes,
whereas all the efforts carried out to locate the stationary points
along the corresponding path for complex <bold>1</bold> were unsuccessful.
As it is evident in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, the substitution reaction in the mono-aquated complex <bold>2</bold> is very favorable from both kinetic and thermodynamic points
of view. Indeed, only 4.9 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> is required
to overcome the activation energy barrier, and the reaction is exergonic
by 10.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.</p><p>On the contrary, the height
of the energy barrier is 19.3 kcal
mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> when the attack of guanine to the mono-aquated
form of complex <bold>3</bold> is taken into consideration, whereas
the thermodynamics continues to be favorable, the reaction being exergonic
by 13.3 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. This computationally evidenced
difference in reactivity of mono-aquo complexes might be one of the
factors useful to rationalize the observed different toxicities.</p><p>Upon examining the water displacement by guanine from the di-aquo
complex, what reported above for the aquation mechanism was taken
into consideration, and given the asymmetry of the PhPy ligand, the
attack on both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> positions
with respect to the C-coordinated atom of the (C^N) ligand was investigated.
Water detachment from the platinum center and guanine binding to it
occur, once again, following a S<sub>N</sub>2 associative mechanism
going through a penta-coordinated transition state TS<sub>Gua</sub>. The first interaction adduct ADD<sub>Gua</sub> is characterized
by a guanine orientation that can be preparatory to both attacks.
However, the attack of guanine from the same side of the N-coordinated
atom requires only 6.4 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to take place
(solid green line in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A), and it is energetically favored with respect to the attack
from the other side (10.0 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, dashed green
line in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A).
The displacement reaction is exergonic by 10.6 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the former case and by 14.5 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in the
latter. On the other hand, guanine displacement by water in the [(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pt(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> complex
occurs overcoming an energy barrier higher than those just discussed
(11.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), whereas the product PROD<sub>Gua</sub> is stabilized by 15.2 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with
respect to the reference adduct.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Free energy profiles describing the guanine

showing that the trans position to the C-coordinated atom of the (C^N)
ligand is the preferred attack of both water and guanine molecules,
the same site was taken into consideration for the substitution reaction
of an oxygen atom of the (O^O) ligand by NAM. As usual, the reaction
starts with the initial interaction of the platinum complex and the
approaching NAM ligand forming the first adduct (ADD<sub>NAM</sub>) and proceeds through a pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal transition state
(TS<sub>NAM</sub>). In the formed product (PROD<sub>NAM</sub>), the
(O^O) ligand remains mono-coordinated to the metal center, and NAM
occupies the coordination site in trans to the C-coordinated atom.
Even in this case, the anionic complex <bold>1</bold>, for both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers, and <bold>2</bold> do not show substantial differences. The attack of NAM requires
18.7 and 18.0 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to take place in <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> and <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>, respectively,
compared to an energy barrier of 19.2 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> computed in the case of <bold>2</bold>. In addition, the detachment

glance, from the data reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>, it appears that the <italic>cis</italic> isomer of complex <bold>1</bold> is more prone to aquation and the
difference is more evident for the first aquation reaction. On the
other side, the slowest step results to be the second hydrolysis for
both complexes <bold>2</bold> and <bold>1</bold>, in its <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> conformations (21.4 and 25.0 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> and <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>, respectively, vs 24.3 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for <bold>2</bold>). The high activation energy calculated for the
hydrolysis (26.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) of complex <bold>3</bold> could explain the very high IC<sub>50</sub> measured for such complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Guanine binding is easily accessible, as expected,
for all di-aquo complexes even if a difference in the barrier height
exists between the aquated form of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> complexes and that of complex <bold>3</bold>. Furthemore, from the
reported data, it emerges that, in addition to a similar propensity
of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> to undergo aquation and, then,
guanine attack, even a possible deactivation by the attack of sulfur-containing
species seems equally probable.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Optical Properties</title><p>The photophysical properties of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>3</bold> in DMSO have been previously discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> In order to investigate the tendency of the Pt(II) complexes to

range, plausibly suggesting a rapid and immediate aquation reaction.

shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>B,
E, respectively. In particular, the absorption spectrum of <bold>2</bold> in the DMSO solution appears stable over time, with a slight decrease,
mostly evident after 24 h, of the broad low-energy band between 380
and 600 nm. The latter was attributed to an MLCT transition involving
the catecholate fragment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> indicative
of, as in the previous case, a possible detachment of the chelate
ligand but with a slower kinetics with respect to that observed for
the anionic compound bearing the alizarine leaving group. The spectral
profile of <bold>2</bold> in aqueous medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>E) shows evident changes compared to that
in DMSO solution. While the ligand-centered (LC) transitions localized
on the cyclometalated ligand (between 280 and 350 nm) appear unchanged,
a new pronounced peak at 379 nm and a considerable decrease of the
charge-transfer band were observed. These features suggest that in
aqueous solution, the displacement of the catecholate ligand occurs,
whereas the new band could be due to the mono or di-aquated compound.
By observing the absorption spectrum of <bold>2</bold> in aqueous
solution over time, a reduction in the optical density was observed
for the whole spectral range, plausibly due to a poor solubility of
the compound in the aqueous medium.</p><p>Finally, the absorption
spectra of <bold>3</bold> are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C, F. At <italic>t</italic> = 0, the absorption
spectrum of the neutral compound in
DMSO (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>C) displays
a weak peak at 357 nm and a broad band centered at 555 nm ascribed,
as for the relative compound <bold>1,</bold> to a charge-transfer
transition from the metal center to the alizarine ligand. After 3
and then 6 and 24 h, the spectral shape changes, showing a progressive
decrease of the band at 357 nm as well as at 555 nm, whereas a shoulder
at 440 nm becomes gradually much more pronounced. Also in this case,
the decrease in the MLCT transition suggests a potential detachment
of the leaving ligand, whereas the other spectral variations could
be due to the simultaneous presence in solution of <bold>3</bold>,
its aquated form, and the free alizarine. Going from the DMSO to the
DMSO/buffer solution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>F), the absorption spectra do not show any change over time,
except for a slight decrease in the optical density probably resulting
from the poor solubility of the neutral compound in aqueous solution.
Therefore, in order to confirm the spectral attributions and shed
light on the spectral features of the mono and di-aquated species,
time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were
performed.</p><p>The absorption spectra in implicit DMSO and water
solvents of the
complexes and all their plausible derivatives that can be formed by
aquation reaction were computed including the mono- and di-aquo complexes
and the free ligand. The outcomes of these calculations are reported
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00842/suppl_file/ic2c00842_si_001.pdf">Figures S3, S4, and Table S1</ext-link>, where
the absorption spectra of all the species, the natural transition
orbitals computed for the most important transitions in water, and
detailed information on each transition are reported. These data confirm
that, as experimentally observed, the solvent environment considerably
influences the relative intensity of the absorption bands. In the
high-energy region of the spectrum (400&#x02013;650 nm), the band is
due to an MLCT transition in all cases. In the spectra of both isomers
of complex <bold>1</bold>, the intensity of such band, generated by
HOMO &#x02192; LUMO electronic transition, decreases with the detachment
of an oxygen atom of the (O^O) ligand in the mono-aquo complex and
completely disappears for the di-aquo complex in both solvents. In
the aqueous environment, for the mono-aquo complex of <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> and <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold>, such a band
is blue-shifted by 57 and 24 nm, respectively. Because the recorded
spectra within 24 h did not exhibit such behavior, it is reasonable
that the <bold>1</bold> complex is rapidly converted into the di-aquo
species. Therefore, the decrease in such band intensity in the explored
time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>A, D)
is compatible with the complete release of the alizarine ligand, and
the persistence of such a band even after the (O^O) ligand detachment
can be ascribable to the presence of the free ligand in solution;
indeed, looking at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00842/suppl_file/ic2c00842_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>, it appears
clear that the intensity of such a band, that becomes the &#x003c0;
&#x02192; &#x003c0;* type, decreases with respect to the MLCT peak found
for both intact and mono-aquo complexes. The computed spectra and
the relative NTOs evidence that the high-energy band is originated
even by a MLCT transition involving the PhPy ligand that falls in
the same region of the LC band.</p><p>A different behavior was observed
for complex <bold>2</bold>. The
MLCT in the low-energy region involves the PhPy ligand, and it is
originated by the electronic transition HOMO &#x02192; LUMO+1. In contrast
to complex <bold>1</bold>, in the case of <bold>2</bold>, when the
mono-aquo complex is formed, its spectral features do not involve
such region of the spectrum, thus the band around 450 nm completely
disappears. This would suggest that most of the <bold>2</bold> complex
remains intact in the investigated temporal range. However, the shape
of the mono-aquo complex also differs in the region 280&#x02013;350
nm, which in this case is characterized by an additional peak. Such
a peak was experimentally observed as well (379 nm), indicating that
only the first aquation should occur. Nevertheless, differently from
the free (Aliz)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> ligand, the spectrum of (BrCat)<sup>2&#x02013;</sup> falls in the shorter wavelength region and is characterized
by decreased band intensities (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c00842/suppl_file/ic2c00842_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>).</p><p>Analogously, in the case of the neutral complex <bold>3</bold>,
the appearance of the shoulder at 440 nm can be ascribed to the formation
of the mono-aquo complex. In such cases, an interesting feature was
observed. Comparing the spectrum of <bold>3</bold> with that of the
free ligand, different from complex <bold>1</bold>, the intensity
of the band in the region 400&#x02013;600 nm is more for the free ligand
than that for the complex, thus the decrease of such a band experimentally
found is incompatible with the complete release of the (O^O) ligand.
Hence, the persistence in the intensity of the LC band and the slight
decrease of the MLCT band suggest that the alizarine remains anchored
to the metal center, being di- or at least mono-coordinated.</p><p>Therefore, photophysical features support the hypothesis that in
the aqueous environment, while complex <bold>1</bold> undergoes water
attack leading to the complete detachment of the (O^O) ligand, most
probably, both <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> complexes within
24 h are converted to the corresponding mono-aquo complexes.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Pharmacological
Evaluation</title><p>With the aim to rationalize the difference in

to a molecular mechanism similar to cisplatin. Moreover, as already

is worth underlining that the estimation of such a parameter
is just a preliminary indication of more intricate aspects, such as
uptake, efflux, cell distribution, and nuclear concentration that
play a pivotal role in defining the cytotoxic profile of an anticancer
drug. Computational studies that focused on modeling such features
are still in progress and, without any doubts, they all influence
the description of the whole mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In order to gain some insights able to support the most significant
cytotoxic effect, previously reported by our group, against MDA-MB-231
exerted by compound <bold>1</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.9 &#x000b1; 1.6
&#x003bc;M), if compared to <bold>2</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> 52.8 &#x000b1;
3.9 &#x003bc;M) and to the relative negligible toxicity shown by <bold>3</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> 126.9 &#x000b1; 2.7), the hydrolysis process
to the corresponding active mono- and di-aquated forms was explored
by DFT calculations. In the case of complex <bold>1</bold>, the asymmetric
structure of the labile alizarine leaving group was taken into consideration,
showing for <bold>1<sub>cis</sub></bold> a lower energy barrier than <bold>1<sub>trans</sub></bold> both in the first (12.1 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> vs 18.9 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) and in the second water substitution
reactions (21.4 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> vs 25.0 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). For both <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, the
second hydrolysis reaction proved to be the rate-determining step,
while for the reference compound <bold>3</bold>, a higher energy barrier
(26.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) was computed for the formation
of the mono-aquated species. Indeed, the absorbance of the complexes <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>3</bold>, monitored spectrophotometrically
within 24 h both in DMSO and in diluted phosphate buffer solution
(DMSO 0.5% v/v, pH 7.4) and computationally reproduced, suggest that
the di-aquo complex is most probably formed only in the case of complex <bold>1</bold>.</p><p>Starting from the assumption that DNA is the main
target responsible
for platinum chemotherapeutics&#x02019; cytotoxicity, the nucleophilic
attack by the N7 site of guanine to displace water from the aquated
active forms was evaluated as well. Taking into consideration the
asymmetric structure of the PhPy ligand in the water displacement
reaction by guanine from the di-aquated forms of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, the nucleophilic attack by N7 of guanine from the side
containing the N-coordinated atom resulted energetically favored,
following a S<sub>N</sub>2 associative mechanism through a penta-coordinated
transition state TS<sub>Gua</sub>, and requiring only 6.4 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> to take place. The energy barrier calculated for
compound <bold>3</bold>, indeed, proved to be higher when considering
the attack by N7 of guanine on both the mono- and di-aquo species
(19.3 and 11.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively). This,
in part, supports the different cytotoxicity exhibited by the selected
Pt(II) complexes against the triple-negative MD-MBA-231 cancer cell
line. In the attempt to comprehensively elucidate this aspect, a plausible
deactivation process was taken into consideration by examining the
reaction with a well-known deactivating sulfur-containing molecule,
NAM. Finally, ICP-MS analysis was performed by incubating the MDA-MB-231
cancer cell line with compounds <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, <bold>3</bold>, and cisplatin up to 6 h, revealing complex <bold>1</bold> preference for DNA with a 10-fold higher concentration of DNA-bound
platinum at 2 &#x003bc;M if compared to the one afforded by cisplatin
at 60 &#x003bc;M. The same behavior was evidenced also in comparison
to the two complexes <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>. The data obtained
with in vitro DNA-binding experiments corroborated the assumption
that DNA is the main target of the herein-proposed complexes. The
values of lipophilicity also confirmed that compound <bold>1</bold> possesses a right balance between lipophilicity and hydrophilicity
(log<italic>P</italic><sub>ow</sub> about 3); on the contrary, the
compound <bold>2</bold> probably has a too high value (log<italic>P</italic><sub>ow</sub> about 4.5). This experimental evidence supports
the ICP-MS analysis that the different leaving group may play an important
role in the internalization of the compounds inside the cells; after
that, the differences in terms of aquation and guanine interaction
processes are not so evident as testified by computational and experimental
data. The synthesis of new Pt(II) complexes containing alizarine is
currently under progress in our laboratories to further investigate
the role of the ligands on their cytotoxic activity, in particular
to investigate the difference brought by the introduction of different
electronegative substituents onto the 2-phenylpyridine ligand.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting
