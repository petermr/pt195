Corpus of papers on 195Pt NMR

Stefan Kuhn added a number of papers. All have 195Pt shifts in them, and they are in principle readable (so none where humans already struggle). Method: searched PMC for 195Pt NMR, restricted that to Research Articles (leaving out a few reviews) and to “Free to read & use”. Looked from the top. Left out everything which either did not actually contain 195Pt shifts or was difficult to understand.
