# pt195
Corpus of papers on 195Pt NMR

Stefan Kuhn added a number of papers. All have 195Pt shifts in them, and they are in principle readable (so none where humans already struggle). Method: searched PMC for 195Pt NMR, restricted that to Research Articles (leaving out a few reviews) and to “Free to read & use”. Looked from the top. Left out everything which either did not actually contain 195Pt shifts or was difficult to understand.

I distinuish a number of common types to report spectra:

## Type 1: 

For each compound, there is a section like this:

    cis-Dichloro-24-[(N-20-aminoeth-10-yl-N)aminocholane-3,6-diol-N]platinum(II) (22c) IR (ATR, cm1): 3393, 3198, 3133, 2929, 2860, 1627, 1453, 1373, 1031; 195Pt NMR (86 MHz, DMF) : -2336.1; HRMS calcd for C26H48Cl2N2O2 196Pt [M + Na]+: 709.2652 found: 709.2644.

In general, this is:

    name (mol id in bold) [other text] 195Pt NMR (frequency, solvent) delta: shiftlist [other text]

Structures are in one or several figures, identified by bold numbers.

In the current selection, papers of type 1 are
PMC6747965
PMC7036801
PMC7693294
PMC7727669
PMC7768359
PMC8038112
PMC8251955
PMC8320711
PMC8402032
PMC8456496
PMC8688915
PMC8713121
PMC8892954
PMC8906972
PMC9029360

These have experimental section, but not the bold structure numbers:

PMC7894172
PMC7998721
PMC8156256
PMC8998453

## Type 2:

Structures are one or several figures, identified by bold numbers. Shifts are given in a table like this:

|Complex |Ox. State |delta Pt (ppm) 195Pt NMR |delta C (ppm) 13C NMR|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|1| +II| -4313| 125.1|
|2| +II| -3814| 138.2|
|3| +II| -3356| 154.7|
|4| +II| -3351| n.o.|
|5| +II| -3304| n.o.|
|6| +IV| -2196| n.o.|
|7| +IV| -2168| 113.4|

## Type 3: Shifts are in running text. It can be similar to the experimental section:

    Combustion and spectral analyses for the cis complex 1: Elemental analysis for formula C8H10N6O4Cl2Pt of compound 1: ... 195Pt NMR (acetone-d6, external standard references K2PtCl4, delta [ppm] = -1618): delta [ppm] = -2091. ... 2: Elemental analysis for formula C8H10N6O4Cl2Pt of the trans-complex 2: ... 195Pt NMR (acetone-d6, external standard reference K2PtCl4, delta [ppm] = -1618): delta [ppm] = -2119. ...
