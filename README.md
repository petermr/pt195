# pt195
Corpus of papers on 195Pt NMR

Stefan Kuhn added a number of papers. All have 195Pt shifts in them, and they are in principle readable (so none where humans already struggle). Method: searched PMC for 195Pt NMR, restricted that to Research Articles (leaving out a few reviews) and to “Free to read & use”. Looked from the top. Left out everything which either did not actually contain 195Pt shifts or was difficult to understand.

I distinuish a number of common types to report spectra:

Type 1: 

For each compound, there is a section like this:

cis-Dichloro-24-[(N-20-aminoeth-10-yl-N)aminocholane-3,6-diol-N]platinum(II) (22c) IR (ATR, cm1): 3393, 3198, 3133, 2929, 2860, 1627, 1453, 1373, 1031; 195Pt NMR (86 MHz, DMF) : -2336.1; HRMS calcd for C26H48Cl2N2O2 196Pt [M + Na]+: 709.2652 found: 709.2644.

In general, this is:
