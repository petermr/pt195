The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to visualize the platinum distribution in the ovarian cancer tissues at the time of interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 27patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Two distinct patterns of platinum distribution were observed. Type A (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;16): platinum accumulation at the adjacent stroma but little in the tumor; type B (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11): even distribution of platinum throughout the tumor and adjacent stroma. The type A patients treated post-surgery with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly shorter periods of recurrence after the last platinum-based chemotherapy session (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.020) and were diagnosed with &#x0201c;platinum-resistant recurrence&#x0201d;. Moreover, type A was significantly correlated with worse prognosis (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031). Post-surgery treatment with non-platinum-based chemotherapy could be effective for the patients classified as type A. Our findings indicate that the platinum resistance can be predicted prior to recurrence, based on the platinum distribution; this could contribute to the selection of more appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, which may lead to improves prognoses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd><kwd>Oncology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K18693</award-id><award-id>19H01147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yoshikawa</surname><given-names>Nobuhisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Kato</surname><given-names>Masashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007325</institution-id><institution>Kobayashi International Scholarship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par10">Approximately 70% of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal dissemination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common subtype of ovarian cancer. Primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard treatment for ovarian cancer, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (NAC-IDS) is another alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Most cases of HGSOC are sensitive to initial platinum-based agents, and with such treatment&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;70% of HGSOC patients can achieve complete remission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, nearly 80% of the patients experience recurrence and become resistant to platinum-based agents, which is related to poor long-term survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par11">In clinical settings, recurrence within 6&#x000a0;months after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy is referred to &#x0201c;platinum-resistant recurrence.&#x0201d; The interval between the date of the last platinum use and the date of relapse detection is called the platinum-free interval (PFI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Whether or not to use platinum-based agents at the time point of a patient&#x02019;s recurrence depends on the patient's PFI. The problem with this strategy is that it allows for the diagnosis of platinum resistance only at the time of tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the PFI is often inconsistent with true platinum resistance, because the PFI does not always reflect molecular mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Novel biomarkers of platinum resistance are needed so that more appropriate drugs can be used for HGSOC earlier in adjuvant treatment, which could prolong the patients&#x02019; survival and minimize adverse effects caused by platinum-based agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">The intracellular platinum concentration has been reported to be correlated with the platinum sensitivity of lung, bladder, and ovarian cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) can detect the platinum concentration in dissociated cells with the use of nitric acid. It has not been possible to distinguish between the platinum distributions in a tumor and the platinum distribution in adjacent stroma, but we speculated that the recently introduced method of laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS), which uses a focused laser ablation system combined with ICP-MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), may be useful for distinguishing these platinum distributions. LA-ICP-MS is used to identify the distribution of trace elements in tissue, and a few investigations using LA-ICP-MS have identified the platinum in cancer patients in whom platinum-based agents had been used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, to our knowledge, no reports on the LA-ICP-MS analysis of platinum distributions to clarify drug resistance and prognosis have been published. We conducted the present study to investigate the usefulness of performing LA-ICP-MS to identify platinum distribution in order to predict of platinum resistance and cancer prognosis at the time of NAC-IDS.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Representative LA-ICP-MS image.

This patient was treated platinum-based agents after the recurrence because PFI was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6 moths at the time of recurrence. However, her recurrent tumor had shown no response to platinum-based treatment, therefore we resected the solitary tumor in abdomen. After the operation, her tumor was considered to be clinically platinum resistant, and regimen was changed to non-platinum-based agents. To our surprise, in this case, platinum was not detected in the tumor area but had accumulated in the adjacent stroma (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Furthermore, multiple sections of tumor tissues were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS. There was little platinum accumulation inside tumor. And platinum was accumulated in the stromal areas (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To be effective for tumor suppression, platinum should enter tumor cells and bind tumor&#x02019;s DNA. Therefore, we hypothesized that platinum is not able to exist in the tumors that do not respond to platinum agents. And we also hypothesized that true platinum sensitivity can be diagnosed by platinum distribution at the tumor margins before recurrence.</p><p id="Par15">We then analyzed the HGSOC samples which were treated with platinum regimens before operation. A total of 27 NAC-IDS patients were enrolled (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We have classified these patients into two groups according to the distribution of platinum by LA-ICP-MS. Type A refers to specimens with low platinum counts in the tumor but with the high platinum counts in the adjacent stroma, whereas type B refers to specimens with the comparable platinum counts both in the tumor and adjacent stroma. Representative images of each type are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B. We could divide stroma from tumor in a sample with high magnified H&#x00026;E staining as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B. And to detect stroma area, immunohistochemistry of &#x003b1;SMA was also useful in some cases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B, Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). A few cases with difficulty to distinguish the tumor with the stroma were analyzed using p53 or Ki-67 staining to detect tumor area correctly. Using IgG conjugated with colloidal gold (Au) as second antibody, LA-ICP-MS could detect the positive p53 or Ki-67 staining area, which meant tumor area. In the type A patients, platinum did not exist in the area of Au (Suppl.

In terms of recurrence, none of the type B patients in type B experienced recurrence within 6&#x000a0;months from the last platinum-based drug.

The platinum distribution identified by LA-ICP-MS can be a reasonable biomarker of true platinum resistance at the time of NAC-IDS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and can provide useful information for the selection of the appropriate chemotherapy after operation.</p><p id="Par22">Platinum resistance, which is currently defined based on the PFI at the time of recurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, is a major problem in ovarian cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The definition using the time of recurrence means that platinum resistance cannot be determined until recurrence is observed, and this is why platinum-based drugs are often used until disease progression (Suppl. Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). In this study, we analyzed NAC-IDS specimens using LA-ICP-MS and observed that platinum could be detected in the cancer tissues and that the distribution of platinum could be quite different between the tumor and the adjacent stroma. The results of our analyses demonstrated that the pattern of platinum distribution was significantly associated with platinum resistance and long-term survival. Based on these results, we speculate that it may be possible to predict the future acquisition of platinum-resistant recurrence at the time of IDS and to identify patients with a poor prognosis due to acquired platinum resistance.</p><p id="Par23">Our LA-ICP-MS analysis revealed that the patients with the type A platinum pattern showed a distinctive distribution of platinum, with an accumulation in the adjacent stroma of the cancer tissues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Various studies of platinum resistance have demonstrated that one of the most reliable mechanisms is a reduction in platinum uptake or an enhanced extracellular efflux of platinum through transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the earlier studies were not able to directly confirm the distribution of platinum in cancer tissues. The inability of platinum to enter to a tumor or efflux from a tumor leads to its accumulation at the tumor margins, and the platinum distribution in the type A pattern with accumulation at the tumor margin is consistent with these mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the characteristic patterns of platinum distribution in cancer tissues. The platinum distribution revealed by LA-ICP-MS could be a promising biomarker of platinum resistance in the treatment of ovarian cancer.</p><p id="Par24">In this study, we could detect platinum in all the samples, even 23 to 53&#x000a0;days after administration of platinum-based agents (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A,B). According to the studies of pharmacokinetics of platinum-based agents, platinum concentrations in plasma decrease rapidly because of its lipophilicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The mean half-life of free platinum in plasma ranged from 6 to 25 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

In erythrocytes, a platinum concentration peak occurring within the 3&#x000a0;h following the end of infusion. Then, concentration of platinum decline slowly, with a mean half-life ranging from 29 to 50 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The mean platinum concentration of plasma or cells are varied between studies because of sampling frequency, study duration, kinds of platinum-based agents, and assay methods. There is no study addressing the half-time of platinum in cancer tissue using LA-ICP-MS. Our findings demonstrated that platinum still existed even 50&#x000a0;days after platinum-based agents.</p><p id="Par25">Our analyses also showed that the TFI was significantly shorter in the type A patients compared to the type B patients, and we suspect that this significant difference is indicative of acquired platinum resistance in the patients treated with platinum-based agents in adjuvant chemotherapy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.020). In our type A patients, the rate of recurrence at&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months, which is the current clinical definition of platinum-resistant recurrence, was 56.3% (9 of 16 patients), and eight of those nine patients (88.9%) were treated with the platinum-based agents even in adjuvant chemotherapy. This result may indicate both anegative effect of using the same platinum-based agents and the potential efficacies of non-platinum-based agents on the prolongation of the TFI in type A patients, who have potentially acquired platinum resistance.</p><p id="Par26">The OS was also significantly worse in the type A group compared to the type B group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031). This may be because platinum-based drugs are often used for type A patients in the current clinical settings since no tool exists to determine platinum resistance at the time of IDS. Actually, six of the eight (75.0%) type A patients treated with the same preoperative platinum-based agents in postoperative treatment died within 2&#x000a0;years. The method of visualizing platinum distribution by LA-ICP-MS may serve as a better biomarker of platinum resistance and contribute to a better treatment strategy for patients with acquired platinum resistance.</p><p id="Par27">We observed that the platinum distribution in the peritoneal dissemination had the same pattern as that in the matched primary tumors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A,B). The primary site (ovaries) is removed at the time of IDS, but the disseminated tumor sometimes remains after operation. Over 70% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer experience recurrence in the abdomen, which is the most common cause of death among ovarian cancer patients: therefore, even if the tumor is thought to be completely removed, most patients are likely to be treated with additional anticancer drugs after surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

We suggest a new ovarian cancer treatment strategy using LA-ICP-MS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). By using LA-ICP-MS analysis after platinum-based agents, we can identify patients who are likely to have a poor prognosis in current clinical settings and then choose the appropriate anti-cancer agents. This strategy can improve patients&#x02019; prognoses.

Only 27 patients from a single institution were included, and underlying biases in our analyses could not be controlled due to the retrospective study design. Prospective larger-scale studies are needed to verify whether treatment strategies that incorporate LA-ICP-MS prolong the prognosis. In this study, we have analyzed only the tissues of ovarian cancer, although platinum-based agents are widely used in various types of tumors. In addition, the areas that can be analyzed by LA-ICP-MS are limited because it takes to analyze by LA-ICP-MS. The present analysis was performed using tissues merely from the border of the tumor and stroma.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, the distribution of platinum was clearly visualized by LA-ICP-MS. The duration to subsequent recurrence was significantly shorter in the type A group, who showed a lower concentration of platinum in the tumor than in the adjacent stroma. LA-ICP-MS is a powerful tool to predict platinum resistance and long-term survival. In the future, the analysis of NAC-IDS specimens using LA-ICP-MS can offer guidance toward more appropriate adjuvant anticancer treatment and can change the treatment strategy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Ovarian cancer samples for LA-ICP-MS analysis</title><p id="Par31">Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Nagoya University (No. 2017-0497).
