MTT assays showed that these complexes exhibit outstanding activity against a range of cancer cell lines, and nanomolar activities were observed. The most potent complex, 4, exhibited a GI50 of 3 nM in the Du145 prostate cancer cell line and was observed to display a 1614-fold increased activity against the HT29 colon cancer cell line relative to cisplatin. ICP-MS studies showed a linear correlation between increased cellular accumulation of the complexes and increased cytotoxicity, while an enzyme immunoassay showed that 1 and 2 inhibited COX-2 at 14 and 1.4 \u00b5M, respectively, which is comparable to the inhibition exhibited by indomethacin. These results suggest that while the cytotoxicity of prodrugs 1-4 was influenced by cellular uptake, it was not entirely dependent on either COX inhibition or lipophilicity.", "affiliation": "School of Science, Western Sydney University, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith South, NSW 2751, Australia.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14040787"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9029360"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC9029360?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2022-04-23", "firstIndexDate": "2022-04-24", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2022-04-25", "dateOfRevision": "2022-04-29", "electronicPublicationDate": "2022-04-03", "firstPublicationDate": "2022-04-03"}
