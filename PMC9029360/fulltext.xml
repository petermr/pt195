Introduction</title><p>Chemotherapy is the most prominent method in cancer therapy, with platinum(II)-based drugs used in ~50% of all treatments [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The first platinum(II)-based drug to gain FDA approval was cisplatin in 1978 (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While cisplatin is routinely deployed to treat a variety of cancers, its efficacy is mitigated by severe toxic side-effects as well as intrinsic or acquired drug resistance [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, following the discovery of the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin, thousands of cisplatin analogues have been developed; carboplatin and oxaliplatin are approved for clinical use worldwide, while nedaplatin, lobaplatin, and heptaplatin (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) have gained approval for regional use, specifically in Asia [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These cisplatin analogues demonstrate improvements in certain aspects of chemotherapy; however, because they are structurally similar, they exhibit similar mechanisms of action to cisplatin, and therefore similar drawbacks [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As cancer continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide, the continued need for improved treatments is crucial.</p><p>Cisplatin and its analogues exert their cytotoxicity by irreversibly binding to DNA, forming inter- and intra-strand adducts, distorting the double helix, and ultimately resulting in apoptosis [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, in a somewhat counterintuitive fashion, despite forming fewer DNA adducts than cisplatin, oxaliplatin exhibits comparable cytotoxicity [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Its ability to perturb ribosome biogenesis and promote immunogenic cell death by facilitating a T cell-dependent immune response is considered a significant contributor to cell death [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, oxaliplatin exhibits improved activity in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Accordingly, the design and development of platinum complexes that demonstrate dissimilar mechanisms of action may circumvent the limitations that challenge current chemotherapeutics.</p><p>A group of platinum(II) complexes that have displayed promising results are of the form [Pt(P<sub>L</sub>)(A<sub>L</sub>)]<sup>2+</sup>, where P<sub>L</sub> is a polyaromatic ligand such as 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) or 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (56Me<sub>2</sub>Phen) and A<sub>L</sub> is a chiral ancillary ligand such as 1<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>,2<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-diaminocyclohexane (SSDACH) [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These complexes exhibit a multimodal mechanism of action through which they have been observed to alter cytoskeletal phenotypes, damage nuclear DNA, reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, and induce epigenetic processes [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This class of complexes exhibit nanomolar in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> values across numerous cancer cell lines; however, this superior activity has not entirely translated in vivo due to poor pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To improve this, they were subsequently oxidised to platinum(IV) ([Pt(P<sub>L</sub>)(A<sub>L</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>) with two hydroxido axial ligands, which demonstrated enhanced activity in vivo [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Platinum(IV) complexes are endowed with a low-spin d<sup>6</sup> octahedral geometry, making them more kinetically stable; this reduces the probability of them reacting with extracellular biomolecules, which decreases the likelihood of side-effects [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The two additional coordination sites provide the potential for different groups to be conjugated, which can improve the pharmacological properties of the complex, including its lipophilicity, selectivity, bioactivity and reduction kinetics [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Platinum(IV) prodrugs are reduced to platinum(II) by intra-/extracellular reducing agents before interacting with their biological targets within the cell [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The advantage of prodrugs is that, in contrast to the various delivery modes of drugs that are used in traditional combination therapy, they can deliver multiple drug moieties in a single pharmacokinetic dose [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The unique properties of platinum(IV) complexes have spawned the development of prodrugs of cisplatin encompassing different enzyme inhibitors [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B30-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several prodrugs of cisplatin incorporating various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. NSAIDs target cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which exist in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed in most tissues, while COX-2 is linked to inflammatory reactions and is overexpressed in many cancers, most prominently in prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancers [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Targeting COX has gained significant interest, as ~20% of cancers manifest chronic inflammation [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous prodrugs comprising of cisplatin with NSAIDs have demonstrated improved cytotoxicity. In certain cases this was due to an enhanced anti-inflammatory response, suggesting a synergistic effect of COX inhibition; in other cases the improved activity was due to enhanced lipophilicity, resulting in enhanced cellular accumulation [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>We present here, for the first time, a group of platinum(IV) prodrugs of the [Pt(P<sub>L</sub>)(A<sub>L</sub>)(COXi)(OH)]<sup>2+</sup> type, where COXi is a COX inhibitor, either indomethacin or aspirin (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). These prodrugs were developed in an attempt to further understand the influence of NSAIDS with platinum-based chemotherapeutics and to improve the activity of [Pt(P<sub>L</sub>)(A<sub>L</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> type complexes. The platinum(IV) complexes were characterised using several biophysical techniques, and their lipophilicity was studied using RP-HPLC. MTT assays were performed in order to determine their cytotoxicity against a panel of malignant cell lines and one non-malignant cell line. To rationalise the cytotoxicity of these complexes, their capacity to inhibit COX-2 was explored, and ICP-MS was employed to determine their cellular accumulation in two different cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceutics-14-00787"><title>2.

To conjugate the COX inhibitors to the di-hydroxido platinum(IV) complexes, the anhydride of aspirin and the NHS ester of indomethacin were initially synthesised. For the synthesis of <bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, the anhydride of aspirin was used in the reaction to afford the mono-substituted product; however, for the synthesis of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, the NHS ester of indomethacin was required as this was more responsive to acylation than the anhydride. The respective anhydride or ester was then coordinated to either <bold>PHENSS(IV)</bold> or <bold>56MESS(IV)</bold> and stirred overnight in minimal DMSO at room temperature in the dark. For the synthesis of all complexes <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold>, only 1.2&#x02013;1.3 molar equivalents of the ligands were required for full conversion.</p><p>The reactions were monitored using <sup>195</sup>Pt NMR and HPLC to determine when the mono-substituted complex had formed and to ensure no unreacted di-hydroxido platinum(IV) remained. In DMSO, a platinum chemical shift of ~330 ppm is indicative of di-hydroxido platinum(IV), and when the inhibitor coordinates to the platinum(IV), a new peak at ~480 ppm appears and increases in intensity with increasing concentration, while the peak at ~330 ppm decreases. The signal at ~480 ppm verifies the formation of mono-substituted platinum(IV) complexes from this group in DMSO [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When the peak at ~330 ppm was no longer visible, the product was precipitated by initially diluting the crude solution with MeOH, followed by the addition of diethyl ether. Flash chromatography was used to isolate the mono-substituted complexes from any unreacted ligands or di-hydroxido platinum(IV). A C18 12 g cartridge column was employed for all complexes.

The NMR spectra of the initial platinum(II) and platinum(IV) di-hydroxido complexes (<bold>PHENSS(II)</bold>, <bold>56MESS(II)</bold>, <bold>PHENSS(IV)</bold> and <bold>56MESS(IV)</bold>) were all in agreement with the published data [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For complexes <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold>, the proton resonances in the aliphatic region arising from the A<sub>L</sub> SSDACH were in agreement with those published in the literature.

The Phen resonances of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> were shifted further downfield compared to the resonances of the di-hydroxido platinum(IV) complexes, consistent with asymmetrical complexes from this group in the literature [<xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The Phen protons closest to the platinum centre exhibited signal splitting attributed to the asymmetry of the octahedral complexes, suggesting that the Phen ligand that constitutes the square plane may adopt a slightly distorted conformation.</p><p>For the assignment of the protons of the axially bound indomethacin in <bold>1</bold>, signals were observed in both the aliphatic and aromatic region of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In the aliphatic region, the singlets at 3.68 and 1.60 ppm, integrating for three protons each, were assigned to the methyl groups of indomethacin (protons H and J, respectively), with proton H exhibiting a further downfield shift due to the deshielding from the oxygen. The resonance at 3.23 ppm correlated to proton I, which was merged with the resonances of H1&#x02032;/H2&#x02032; from SSDACH. Protons from the aromatic rings on the indomethacin produced four signals in the aromatic region of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum. The multiplet at 7.53 ppm integrated for four protons and was assigned to protons A&#x02013;D from the aromatic ring, as these were shifted furthest downfield due to the electronegativity of the chloro group. The doublet of doublet at 6.47 ppm, with an integration of one proton, was coupled with the resonances at 6.32 (ortho, <italic toggle="yes">J</italic> = 9.04 Hz) and 6.18 (meta, <italic toggle="yes">J</italic> = 2.59 Hz) ppm in the COSY spectrum (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S7</xref>), and was thus assigned to proton G.

The assignment of resonances in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of <bold>2</bold> followed a similar rationale to that described for <bold>1</bold>, with the exception of the proton resonances for G and F merging into a single signal appearing at 6.47 ppm (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S10</xref>).</p><p>For the assignment of the protons of the axially coordinated aspirin in <bold>3</bold>, one signal was observed in the aliphatic region, while there were four peaks in the aromatic region (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S14</xref>). The singlet at 1.60 ppm integrated for three protons and was therefore assigned to the protons of the methyl group (E). In the aromatic region, the doublets at 7.59 and 6.88 ppm, integrating for one proton each, were assigned to protons A and D, respectively. In the COSY spectrum, the triplet at 7.18 ppm was coupled to A and to the triplet at 7.42 ppm, which displayed coupling to D; accordingly, these were assigned to B and C, respectively. The assignment of resonances in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of <bold>4</bold> followed the same rationale as in <bold>3</bold> (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S18</xref>). The amine proton resonances were not visible in any of the spectra due to exchange with D<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>To confirm conjugation of the axial ligands to the platinum centre, the <sup>195</sup>Pt and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>195</sup>Pt HMQC NMR spectra were obtained. Due to the sensitivity of the platinum coordination sphere, a significant difference in the chemical shift was observed when this was altered [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Platinum(II) and di-hydroxido platinum(IV) complexes from this class of compounds have chemical shifts of ~&#x02212;2800 and ~400 ppm (in D<sub>2</sub>O), respectively [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

For <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, with the P<sub>L</sub> Phen, the most notable absorbance bands were observed at 201 and 202 nm, respectively, with the second bands at 276 and 279 nm, respectively, arising from the Phen &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0;* transitions. In <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold>, consisting of the P<sub>L</sub> 56Me<sub>2</sub>Phen, two similar strong absorbance bands were exhibited; however, they were red-shifted compared to the Phen derivatives. This red-shift was more prominent in the 280 nm region, where <bold>2</bold> exhibited a red-shift of 6 nm compared to <bold>1</bold>, and <bold>4</bold> exhibited a red-shift of 12 nm compared to <bold>3</bold>. This red-shift is attributed to the methyl groups on the P<sub>L</sub> and was confirmed by the UV spectra of the individual P<sub>L</sub>, which shows the peak absorbances of 56Me<sub>2</sub>Phen to be red-shifted compared to those exhibited by Phen (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S35</xref>).

The third absorbance band depicted in the spectra of all prodrugs, at ~310 nm, is owing to MLCT interactions, which shows the 56Me<sub>2</sub>Phen prodrugs (<bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) to be red-shifted (by ~10 nm) compared to the Phen prodrugs (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold>). Additionally, the aspirin prodrugs (<bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) were slightly red-shifted (by ~3 nm) compared to the indomethacin prodrugs (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>). This may be influenced by the strong absorbance exhibited by indomethacin at ~320 nm (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a).

As the chirality of SSDACH is a major contributing factor to the activity of these compounds, it is essential that the chirality of this ligand was retained during synthesis. The CD spectra of the indomethacin prodrugs (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) exhibited negative peaks at ~208 nm and positive peaks at ~270 nm, with <bold>2</bold> showing two additional negative peaks at 242 and 295 nm (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figures S36 and S37</xref>). There is evidence of a signal at ~290 nm for <bold>1</bold>; however, it could not be clearly defined within the operating range of the instrument. SRCD spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> were obtained to gain data below 200 nm, and while no additional peaks were observed, the peak at 290 nm for <bold>1</bold> was much more prominent and thus able to be clearly identified (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figures S38 and S39</xref>). The peaks in the CD spectra for the aspirin prodrugs (<bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) were much less defined than the spectra of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, and only the negative peaks at ~215 nm were clearly identified (<xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figures S40 and S41</xref>).

Cisplatin exhibited a 28-fold decrease in activity in the cisplatin-resistant ADDP cell line as compared to the A2780 cell line (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>c). Prodrugs <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold>, on the other hand, only exhibited a 1.1&#x02013;1.8-fold decrease in the cisplatin-resistant cell line, indicating that these prodrugs can overcome cisplatin resistance. Overall, compared to cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, most complexes exhibited significantly enhanced activity, with <bold>4</bold> showing 1614-fold increase in activity relative to cisplatin against the HT29 colon cancer cell line (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>b). While <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> exhibited remarkable activity across the entire panel of cancer cell lines, they exhibited activity in the non-cancerous MCF10A breast cell line as well.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-pharmaceutics-14-00787"><title>3.7. COX Inhibition</title><p>To explore the in vitro COX inhibitory properties of these complexes, they were assessed using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) against the COX-2 enzyme. The COX-2 enzyme was chosen as it is upregulated in certain tumours and contributes to tumour progression [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Several different concentrations of the indomethacin and aspirin compounds were assessed; however, higher concentrations were selected for aspirin because it is a less potent inhibitor of COX-2 compared to indomethacin [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Aspirin and the aspirin prodrugs (<bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) were prepared at concentrations ranging from (7&#x02013;700 &#x000b5;M), with aspirin only showing minimal (19%) COX-2 inhibition at 700 &#x000b5;M. No inhibition was exhibited by <bold>3</bold>, <bold>4</bold>, or aspirin at lower concentrations (7 and 70 &#x000b5;M, as depicted in <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S44</xref>), suggesting the need for higher concentrations. Contrary to this, indomethacin and the indomethacin prodrugs (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) exhibited COX-2 inhibition, despite being prepared at lower concentrations of 14 and 1.4 &#x000b5;M. As depicted in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, at 14 &#x000b5;M, <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> showed 63% and 61% inhibition, respectively, and at 1.4 &#x000b5;M, <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> showed 29% and 71% inhibition, respectively. Indomethacin on its own exhibited 87% and 75% inhibition at 14 and 1.4 &#x000b5;M, respectively. While the COX-2 inhibition shown by <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> was not as effective as indomethacin, the results suggest that the complexes may bind to the COX-2 enzymes, or alternatively reduce and then release the ligands, which then bind to the enzymes.</p><p>No correlation between COX inhibition and the in vitro cytotoxicity of these complexes was evident. While the aspirin complexes exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity, the indomethacin complexes displayed enhanced COX inhibition. It is possible that the in vitro cytotoxicity of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> is not necessarily a result of COX inhibition and could be due to other factors. Nevertheless, the exhibited COX-2 inhibitory properties of <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> indicate they may be able to reduce tumour-associated inflammation and could be selective towards tumours that overexpress this enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot8-pharmaceutics-14-00787"><title>3.8. Platinum Uptake Studies</title><p>Cellular accumulation studies of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> and their platinum(II) and platinum(IV) precursors, as well as cisplatin, were carried out using the A2780 (ovarian) and ADDP (cisplatin-resistant ovarian) cancer cell lines. ICP-MS was used to determine cellular platinum levels after the cells were exposed to concentrations of 1.0 and 0.1 &#x000b5;M of each compound for 4 h (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>a and <xref rid="app1-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="app">Figure S45</xref>). These conditions were chosen as a compromise between the high toxicity of these platinum complexes and the quantification range of platinum by ICP-MS. As depicted in <xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>a, the platinum uptake levels of <bold>3</bold> were 1.2&#x02013;1.6-fold greater than <bold>1</bold>, and the platinum uptake levels of <bold>4</bold> were 1&#x02013;1.3-fold greater than <bold>2</bold>. These results show that the aspirin complexes (<bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) exhibited greater uptake than their analogous indomethacin counterparts (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, respectively). The order of increasing platinum uptake is <bold>1</bold> &#x0003c; <bold>3</bold> &#x0003c; <bold>2</bold> &#x0003c; <bold>4</bold>, which differs from the order of increasing lipophilicity (<bold>3</bold> &#x0003c; <bold>4</bold> &#x0003c; <bold>1</bold> &#x0003c; <bold>2</bold>), indicating that lipophilicity is not the predominant factor in their uptake. It is possible that the uptake of these complexes may be influenced more significantly by active transport mechanisms.</p><p>There is a linear correlation between the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of the complexes (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>b,c), showing that as the platinum uptake level increases, the cytotoxicity does as well (i.e., the GI<sub>50</sub> values decrease). The least cytotoxic compound, cisplatin, exhibited the lowest uptake. This was followed by the Phen derivatives (<bold>PHENSS(IV)</bold>, <bold>PHENSS(II)</bold>, <bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold>), while the 56MESS derivatives (<bold>56MESS(IV)</bold>, <bold>56MESS(II)</bold>, <bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold>), were the most cytotoxic and exhibited higher levels of intracellular uptake. While the uptake level of cisplatin in the ADDP cell line was the lowest, it was only ~two-fold lower than <bold>PHENSS(IV)</bold>, which exhibited the next highest uptake. When comparing the GI<sub>50</sub> values of these two compounds, cisplatin was ~22-fold less active than <bold>PHENSS(IV)</bold>. Cisplatin was therefore omitted from this correlation in the ADDP cell line (<xref rid="pharmaceutics-14-00787-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>c), as it is resistant to ADDP and due to its high GI<sub>50</sub> value it skews the graph. This indicates that cisplatin&#x02019;s resistance in this cell line is not a result of its uptake. For the rest of the complexes in the ADDP cell line and for all complexes in the A2780 cell line, the results indicate that their higher cellular uptake may be contributing to the enhanced cytotoxicity exhibited by these complexes; however, it is not clear whether their lipophilicity influences their activity. This is inconsistent with data reported previously for similar complexes, which displayed no clear correlation between lipophilicity, cytotoxicity and platinum uptake. This could be due to the nature of the axial ligands (indomethacin and aspirin) as compared to the long-chain fatty acids used previously, as well as the differences in the tested cell lines [<xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-14-00787" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-pharmaceutics-14-00787"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>A group of platinum(IV) prodrugs of the type [Pt(P<sub>L</sub>)(A<sub>L</sub>)(COXi)(OH)]<sup>2+</sup> (where P<sub>L</sub> is Phen or 5,6-Me<sub>2</sub>Phen and A<sub>L</sub> is SSDACH), all of which contain a COX inhibitor (where COXi is either indomethacin or aspirin) in the axial position, were synthesised, characterised and assessed for their biological activity. The complexes were characterised using NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, ESI-MS, UV and CD spectroscopy, as well as SRCD for <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>, which together confirmed the successful synthesis and purity of each complex. Preliminary reduction studies via <sup>1</sup>H NMR of <bold>3</bold> showed that it reduced to its platinum(II) congener, thus confirming the successful release of its axial ligand. The lipophilicity of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> was determined using RP-HPLC, with the produced <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm10" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> values indicating that the complexes with indomethacin in the axial position (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) were more lipophilic than those with aspirin in the axial position (<bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>).</p><p>MTT assays were used to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity of <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> against a panel of cell lines. The most cytotoxic prodrug was complex <bold>4</bold>, which exhibited a GI<sub>50</sub> value as low as 3 nM against the Du145 prostate cancer cell line. Almost all of the prodrugs exhibited exceptional cytotoxicity when compared to traditional drugs such as cisplatin, with the most cytotoxic prodrug, <bold>4</bold>, exhibiting 1614-fold enhancement in activity relative to cisplatin in the HT29 colon cancer cell line. Furthermore, <bold>1</bold>&#x02013;<bold>4</bold> showed that they can overcome cisplatin resistance in the ADDP (cisplatin-resistant) ovarian cancer cell line. The enzyme immunoassay showed that the indomethacin prodrugs (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold>) inhibited 29&#x02013;71% of COX-2 expression at concentrations of 14 and 1.4 &#x000b5;M, comparable to indomethacin alone, while aspirin and the aspirin prodrugs (<bold>3</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) did not exhibit COX-2 inhibition despite being tested at higher concentrations. Platinum uptake studies showed that the prodrugs with the 56MESS core (<bold>2</bold> and <bold>4</bold>) exhibited greater uptake than those with the PHENSS core (<bold>1</bold> and <bold>3</bold>), and the aspirin complexes exhibited 1&#x02013;1.6-fold greater uptake compared to the indomethacin complexes with the same core.</p><p>Overall, the prodrugs incorporating aspirin exhibited greater cytotoxicity compared to those incorporating indomethacin with the same platinum(II) core. Juxtaposed to this, the indomethacin prodrugs exhibited greater COX inhibition and increased lipophilicity. Although there was no clear correlation between lipophilicity, COX inhibition or cytotoxicity, a linear trend between increasing cellular uptake and increasing cytotoxicity was observed. While it is apparent that cellular uptake plays a role in the cytotoxicity of these prodrugs, it is not entirely clear how lipophilicity and COX inhibition influence this activity. The lack of correlation between the lipophilicity and uptake in these complexes warrants mechanistic studies into their cellular uptake mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-pharmaceutics-14-00787"><title>5.
