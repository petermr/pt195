Stimulated by this sensitivity magnification, this study presents PROgressive Saturation of the Proton Reservoir (PROSPR), a method for enhancing the NMR sensitivity of dilute heteronuclei in static solids. PROSPR aims at using these heteronuclei to progressively deplete the abundant <sup>1</sup>H polarization found in most organic and several inorganic solids, and implements this <sup>1</sup>H signal depletion in a manner that reflects the spectral intensities of the heteronuclei as a function of their chemical shifts or quadrupolar offsets. To achieve this, PROSPR uses a looped cross-polarization scheme that repeatedly depletes <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H local dipolar order and then relays this saturation throughout the full <sup>1</sup>H reservoir via spin-diffusion processes that act as analogues of chemical exchanges in the CEST experiment. Repeating this cross-polarization/spin-diffusion procedure multiple times results in an effective magnification of each heteronucleus's response that, when repeated in a frequency-stepped fashion, indirectly maps their NMR spectrum as sizable attenuations of the abundant <sup>1</sup>H NMR signal. Experimental PROSPR examples demonstrate that, in this fashion, faithful wideline NMR spectra can be obtained. These <sup>1</sup>H-detected heteronuclear NMR spectra can have their sensitivity enhanced by orders of magnitude in comparison to optimized direct-detect experiments targeting unreceptive nuclei at low natural abundance, using modest hardware requirements and conventional NMR equipment at room temperature.", "affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 7610001, Israel.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "DMR-1644779", "agency": "Division of Materials Research", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "965/18", "agency": "Israel Science Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "Perlman Family Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "642773", "agency": "H2020 Marie Sk??odowska-Curie Actions", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2003854", "agency": "National Science Foundation", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "State of Florida", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c08277"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8640991"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8640991?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2022-02-02", "dateOfCreation": "2021-11-18", "firstIndexDate": "2021-11-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-12-13", "dateOfRevision": "2022-02-02", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-11-18", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-11-18"}
